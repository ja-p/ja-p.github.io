Static site to be built with Hugo

Currently being deployed through the Github Action defined in `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`

For first setup, had to set repository settings: Pages -> Source: `Branch: gh-pages`, Folder: `/ (root)`

Otherwise, Jekyll would takeover and build the website from `main` branch.
