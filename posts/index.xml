This is a write-up about a track of 3 flags around SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection) in Go. The context is that we are auditing an application used to draft marketing emails through a template.
My team ended up being the first to complete the whole track.
Note The main.go files can be built and ran and during the CTF I was debugging locally most of the time.</description></item></channel></rss>
