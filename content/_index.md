Hello, 

I am a security research enthusiast with a software engineering background who mostly goes by the moniker **Fish in Space** while online. Yes, it is somewhat inspired by the character in Chicken Little.

On my spare time, I enjoy CTF events and have a special place in my heart for [NSEC](https://nsec.io/) and [Hackfest](https://hackfest.ca/). I specialize in web application challenges, but anything that can teach me something new is worthwhile. I have occasionally designed some CTF challenges.

Currently certified **OSWE**, **GCIH** and working towards **OSCP**.  For a few years now, I have also been learning on platforms like **Pentesterlab**, **Hackthebox**, **Root-Me**, **RingZer0CTF**.

This blog is my attempt at sharing knowledge and my thoughts which may be cybersecurity related or not.
